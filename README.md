# Armored Tracked Vehicle - Concept Design

This is a concept design of an armored tracked vehicle, created for learning and experimentation with mechanical design, track suspension, and overall vehicle structure. The model was developed entirely in CAD as a personal project.

## Overview

The vehicle follows the general layout of a tank destroyer with a fixed upper hull and front-mounted cannon. It features a full tracked system with detailed suspension and roller components.

### Key Features 

- Fully modeled track and suspension system
- Eight road wheels per side with support structure
- Fixed upper hull with sloped frontal armor
- Forward-mounted cannon (can be replaced with sensor module or manipulator arm for rebranding)
- Simple modular structure for future add-ons

## Tools Used

- Fusion 360 (CAD modeling)

## Notes

This project was created for fun and personal learning. It is not intended for real-world use or replication. The model can be adapted into various forms such as an exploration rover or recovery vehicle depending on application and attachments.
